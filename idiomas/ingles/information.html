          <p>  
              Inequality and poverty are two serious problems in our society. Inequality is when some people have a lot of money and others barely have enough to survive. And poverty is when you don't have access to basic things like a decent home, enough food, or medical care.
              The sad thing is that, even though we live in a world with a lot of technology and money, the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing. And that not only affects people who don't have much, but it also causes problems in society in general.
              To solve this, we need to make several changes. We should make sure that everyone has access to important things like education, health, and a fair job. And we also need to change the way we think about differences between people, like those based on gender or race.
              The goal is to create a world where everyone has the same opportunities to live a good life. And that's not only fair, but it's also better for everyone in general. Because when everyone is doing well, society functions much better.

          <p>Although the way out of the recent crises has been very different from that taken in 2008, the truth is that poverty and social exclusion continue to be a pending problem affecting 12.3 million people in our country, according to the data from the XIII Report 'The State of Poverty in Spain' by EAPN-ES.</p>
          <p>The cost of housing, the gender gap, and inadequate support for families with children have been key factors in generating poverty in Spain. The recovery of families is being hindered by the effects of inflation, the price of energy, and constantly rising rents and mortgages, which prevent millions of people from having a dignified life.</p>
          <p>Inequality in Spain is a significant challenge in economic, social, and gender terms. The 2008 crisis left many people in precarious economic situations, exacerbating existing disparities. Although progress has been made, there are still gaps in access to education, health, and employment. Gender inequality remains a problem, with wage gaps and barriers to leadership and security. Additionally, there are forms of racial discrimination and difficulties for people with disabilities. Addressing this inequality requires continuous and coordinated efforts to achieve equitable and sustainable development.</p>
