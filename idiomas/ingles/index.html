          <p>  Unevenness and poorness are two serious problems in sociedal nuestra. sSabes, unevenness is how to cook some people have much to eat and other dependants have to survive. And poor people take care of themselves not have access to basic things such as a decent house, enough comida or medidica care.
            The sad thing is that, when we come together, we live in a world with much technology and money, the gap between rich and poor, if I believe. Y eso does not only affect people who do not have mucho, but also causes problems in society in general.
            For resolver esto, we need varios cambios. Let us make sure that all of them have access to important things such as education, health and fair work. And we also need to explore the way we think about the differences between people, such as those based on género or raza.
            The objective is to create a world of all who have the mismas opportunidades para vivir una buena vida. And it is not only fair, but it is also better for all in general. Because we're doing all this, the partnership works mucho mejor.

        <p>Although the outcome of the latest crises has been very different from that taken in 2008, the truth is that poverty and social exclusion continue to be a pending problem that affects 12.3 million people in our country, according to data from the XIII Report 'The State of Poverty in Spain' by EAPN-ES.</p>
        <p>The cost of housing, the gender gap and insufficient support for families with children have become key factors in generating poverty in Spain. The recovery of families is being hindered by the effects of inflation, the price of energy, and constantly rising rents and mortgages, which prevent millions of people from having a life in decent conditions.</p>
